# TODO

- [ ] CLI tool (removed insecure owner setup tool)
- [x] Bot ownership hierarchy overhaul (using Discord's native permissions with custom moderator support)
- [ ] Beautifying every response
- [ ] Renaming categories of commands into modules (sports module sounds better than category etc..)
- [WIP] Fantasy premier league integration, league standings command etc
